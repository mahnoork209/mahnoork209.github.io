                <p>BTS brought in the name of their fans by naming them ARMY.

                    !!I Purple You!!
              BTS' vocalist V aka Kim Taehyung is no stranger<br> to coining words and phrases that have a major impact on their massive fanbase. He gave<br> ARMY the phrase Borahae that means I Purple You which has become a part of BTS' identity<br> now and he may have just started a new era too! For those of you who may be unaware.As<br> fans know, ARMY was established as BTS' fandom name on July 9, 2013, soon after the<br> release of the band's first single, “2 Cool 4 Skool.” The word is an acronym for “Adorable.<br>Representative M.C. For Youth,” but there are also other meanings.. Bangtan Sonyeondan aka Bulletproof Boy Scouts aka Behind The Scenes is the beloved South Korean boy group and world music icons.Purple is the rainbow's last hue. Purple signifies I will trust and love you for a long time, he explained. The audience erupted in delight in reaction to Taehyung's comment, while his BTS bandmates were perplexed as to how he managed to conjure up such an evocative meaning for the colorful hue off the top of his head.
