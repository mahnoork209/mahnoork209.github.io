            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, <br>is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010 and debuting in 2013 under Big Hit-<br> Entertainment.They are—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material.<br>
                Members: Jin; Suga; J-Hope; RM; Jimin; V; Jugkook<br>
                Hangul: 방탄소년단<br>
                Origin: Seoul, South Korea.<br>Every K-Pop group has their own unique official greeting that they use to properly introduce themselves. BTS's greeting starts off with their leader, Rap Monster, saying, “2! 3!” before the others join in and say, “Hello, we are BTS.”Since their formation, BTS have believed that telling their own stories is the best way for the younger generation to relate to their music. Writing many of their own lyrics, the group discusses universal life experiences such as sadness and loneliness in their work and turn them into something lighter and more manageable. RM stated that BTS tries to avoid a preaching or reprimanding tone in their songs "because that's not the way that we want to spread our message ... We're born with different lives, but you cannot choose some things. So we thought that love, the real meaning of it, starts with loving ourselves and accepting some ironies and some destinies that we have from the very start.</p>
